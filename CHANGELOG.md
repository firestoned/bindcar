**Author:** Erick Bourgeois

### Added
- HTTP REST API for managing BIND9 zones via rndc commands
- Structured zone configuration with type-safe JSON API
- Support for SOA records, NS records, and all common DNS record types
- Bearer token authentication
- Health check and readiness endpoints
- RNDC executor with async command execution
- Zone file generation from structured configuration
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Features
- **Zone Management**: Create, delete, reload zones

### Why
Extracted from the [bindy Kubernetes operator](https://github.com/firestoned/bindy) to provide
a standalone HTTP API for BIND9 management that can be used in any environment (Docker, VMs,
bare metal) - not just Kubernetes.

### Impact

- [ ] Breaking change
